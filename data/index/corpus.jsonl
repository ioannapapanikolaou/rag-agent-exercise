In Q2, breadth weakened while the headline advanced. Returns were concentrated in a narrow cohort of mega-cap growth names. We maintained modest tilts to Momentum and Quality , with a small Value neutralizer to mitigate sector concentration. 1. Market Overview US equities, proxied by SPY, extended gains during the quarter with higher sensitivity around macro data releases. For reference during the quarter, SPY was quoted at 529.40 on 2025\u201106\u201110 and subsequently consolidated into month\u2011end."}

This addendum clarifies positioning nuances from the primary Q2 letter. Positioning Clarifications: Early in the quarter, internal notes considered a modest long Value posture to capture perceived dislocations in quality/value spreads. Subsequent review returned Value to a neutralizing role by mid\u25a0quarter, consistent with the primary letter\u2019s stance. Reference Levels and Dates: For consistency with internal files used for this exercise, SPY closed at 527.15 on 2025\u25a006\u25a020 (later than the 2025\u25a006\u25a010 mark cited in commentary)."}
